# wallpaper-changer
A wallpaper background changers for lxde/lubuntu that uses python.
Only works with pcmanfm because it uses the file manager to set the background.

use it like:
python wallpaperchanger [pictureDirector] [delay]

where pictureDirector is the directory where the pictures are stored.

and where delay is the delay between switching form picture to picture in seconds.
